# A small repo, where I explore the concept of monads by building my own

## Work based on 'Functional programming, simplified' by Alvin Alexander
## Also, a lot of googling

So far, I've implemented (and maybe even understood) the following monads :

* Wrapper
* Reader
* Writer
* Option
* IO
* State

...  as well as the StateT monad transformer.

Still to come : A short and simple FP game is coming up, based on [this](https://github.com/jdegoes/lambdaconf-2014-introgame)
