# A small repo, where I explore the concept of monads by building my own


Work based on 'Functional programming, simplified' by Alvin Alexander - as well as googling

So far, I've implemented (and maybe even understood) the following monads :

* Wrapper
* Reader
* Writer
* Option
* IO
* State

...  as well as the StateT monad transformer, and the world-famous Show typeclass.
