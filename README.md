# A small repo, where I explore concepts like monads by building my own


Work based on: 

* 'Functional programming, simplified' by Alvin Alexander
* 'Scala with Cats' by Noel Welsh & Dave Gurnell

So far, I've implemented (and maybe even understood) the following monads :

* Wrapper
* Reader
* Writer
* Option
* IO
* State
* StateT monad transformer
* Show typeclass.
